      <h1>Oklahoma Autonomous Interactive Robotics Lab (AIROU)</h1>
      <p>
         AIROU is a research lab at the University of Oklahoma with a focus on the building and 
         designing of autonomous vehicles using visual navigation. The team consists of both undergraduate and graduate students 
         and is led by Dr. Golnaz Habibi. Our mission is to design and build autonomous ground and aerial vehicles that can navigate
         safely in real environments.

  <h1>AIROU Mission</h1>
  <p>
    Our mission is to design and build autonomous ground and aerial vehicles that can navigate safely in real environments. 
    <br><br>
    
    Our intelligent agents can collaborate and interact with each other, 
    creating a heterogenous team of vehicles that collaboratively or individually accomplish a variety of tasks such as: 
    delivery, transportation system, weather forecast, search and rescue, and mapping. <br><br>
    Our projects spans broad aspects of robotics and AI, including but not limited to: <br><br>
    &#x2022; Machine Learning <br>
    &#x2022; Reinforcement Learning <br>
    &#x2022; Multi-agent Systems <br>
    &#x2022; Data Fusion <br>
    &#x2022; Localization and Mapping (SLAM) <br>
    &#x2022; Robust Control and Navigation <br>
    &#x2022; Autonomous Driving <br>
    &#x2022; Computer Vision. <br>

    <p> Last October, our lab members Daniel Vargas, Yuki Zheng, and Tyler Roman were able to attend the 
      Oklahoma Transportation Research Day. <br>

      Lab member, Daniel, presented his work on the implementation of localizing and mapping
      with advanced AI for autonomous navigation, and presented his MUSHr racecar project our lab is using 
      to test our visual navigation and simulations.
      <br><br>
      Lab members, Yuki and Tyler, presented their poster exploring AIROU's 
      project for collaborative multi-view perception for a safe, robust, and scalable autonomous driving system. 
      Some topics covered include 3-D multi-object detection, sensor fusion, multi-object tracking, 
      collaborative learning, localization, and mapping.
